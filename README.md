# Sorting-Algorithms
This project demostrates various sorting algorithms, all with descritiptions into how they work
It contains sorting algorithms like bubble sort, insertion sort, shell sort, and selection sort.
In the main, there is commented out code sections if the user wishes to see results printed in the console. However, you are going to have to edit the saveFile method to do so. 
Otherwise, the results can be seen in a text file where this file is downloaded on the user's PC and the location, it will generate a text file with results of the sorted lists of numbers,
time taken, and iterations taken to do so.
